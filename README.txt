Project Name : Software Tool to measure the effect of teacher presence in discussion forum of MOOCs on Peer Learning.


Massive Online Open Courses are online courses that provide interactive user forums or discussion forums that build a community for students and professors where it becomes important to measure the effect of teachers' presence in these forums.
The learning in the forum of the IITB course has various categories and due to the huge number of participants involved in the course, it makes manual classification impractical.
A classification model was built which helps in automating the process of categorizing the input messages of the discussion forum into their type of learning. After the classification, analysis was done to check whether teacher intervention resulted in a higher-order level of learning.
The proposed system helped in analyzing how the presence of teachers in MOOCs contributes to the quality of students learning since it is difficult to quantify this manually.
